<p>Metamorphosis is a series of major changes in an animal&apos;s body form as it moves through its life cycle. Butterflies and moths undergo a complete metamorphosis, which means there are four separate stages in the life cycle (egg, larva, pupa, and adult). Each stage looks completely different and serves a different purpose in the life of the insect.</p>
<div id="egg">
    <h1>EGG</h1>
   <p> Egg Stage: Female Lepidoptera (the group butterflies and moths belong in) often 
    require specific plants, called host plants, on which to lay eggs. A butterfly usually 
    lays 200-500 eggs which vary in shape and size depending on the species. Most species 
    hatch in four to five days, while others may take as long as three weeks.</p></div>
    <div id="cater">
        <h1>Caterpillar</h1>
   <p> Larva Stage: When the eggs hatch, tiny caterpillars begin feeding and growing. Its 
    first meal is usually the eggshell, which provides it with important nutrients. Then 
    it will begin eating the host plant. Almost all caterpillars eat leaves but some eat 
    stems, roots, fruits, seeds, seed pods or flowers. They will eat only the host plant and 
    will not move to any adjacent plant of a different species – even if it runs out of food. 
    As they eat and their bodies expand, their skin (an exoskeleton with a limited stretching 
    capacity) becomes tight and eventually splits and sheds, revealing new skin beneath. This 
    is called molting and occurs several times as the larva grows.</p></div>
    <div id="pupa">
        <h1>Pupa</h1>
    <p>illustration showing butterfly life cycle from egg to Larva (caterpillar) pupa
         (chrysalis) to adultPupa Stage: When the caterpillar has grown enough, it finds 
         a protected spot, molts for the last time, and forms an encasement in which they 
         metamorphose. During this stage, most moth caterpillars spin a silken cocoon while 
         most butterfly caterpillars form a chrysalis. The pupa undergoes tremendous change.
          The caterpillar releases digestive juices that break down most of its body into a 
          “tissue cell soup” from which it develops four wings, new legs, new eyes, new 
          mouthparts, and genitalia. When the insect emerges, its metamorphosis is complete.</p>
