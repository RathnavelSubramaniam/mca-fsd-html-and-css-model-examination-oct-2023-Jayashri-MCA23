    <p>Found at the top of the head are the antennae. These are sensory organs which detect chemicals in the air - to help the butterfly find food, or a mate. Just like other insects, butterflies have compound eyes which are made up of lots of tiny lenses. They can detect light and dark and colour, and they are able to detect movement in many directions at once. The mouth parts of the butterfly enable them to feed. 
        They feed on nectar using a long, drinking straw like structure called a proboscis.</p>
